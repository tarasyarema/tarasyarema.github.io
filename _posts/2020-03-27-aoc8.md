This post is about the [day 8 problem of the Advent Of Corona challenge](https://adventofcorona.hackersatupc.org/#/problem/8).

## The problem

You are given 3 `TCP` connections:

- A test one: `68.183.210.250:32779`
- Phase 1: `68.183.210.250:32780`
- Phase 2: `68.183.210.250:32781`

Your goal is to get a flag, but... Which flag?

## The solution

> Disclaimer: I won't give the flags here. Try to solve it by your own, or run the solution script **after** understanding it if you want to get the flags. It's up to you in the end...

If you play with the test connection, for example running it via `telnet`:

```sh
$ telnet 68.183.210.250 32779
```

You see a tic-tao-toe game. If you win the bot you will get a flag in the format `flag{xxx}`.

As the problem states, there's a timeout of 2s and 3s for the first and second phase, respectively.

My approach is to try to solve it via a random algorithm, i.e. just pick a random empty cell every time. 

Here is the code:

```python
from telnetlib import Telnet
from time import time

connections = [
    ("test", "68.183.210.250", 32779, 3),
    ("phase_0", "68.183.210.250", 32780, 3),
    ("phase_1", "68.183.210.250", 32781, 6)
]

for t, h, p, s in connections:
    tn = Telnet(h, p)

    tn.read_until(str.encode("give me a name: "))
    tn.write(str.encode("taras"))
    tn.read_until(str.encode("\n"))

    tt = time()

    while True:
        try:
            d = []
            d_tmp = []

            for _ in range(s):
                try:
                    tmp = tn.read_until(str.encode("\n"))

                except Exception:
                    flag = bytes.decode(d_tmp[0]).replace("\n", "")

                    print(f"{t}: {flag} - {time()-tt:2.4f} s.")
                    raise Exception("end")

                d_tmp.append(tmp)
                d += bytes.decode(tmp).replace("\n", "").split("|")[1:-1]
            
            d = [ dd.replace(" ", "") for dd in d ]
            tn.read_until(str.encode("give me a position (comma separated): "))

            for i in range(len(d)):
                if d[i] == "":
                    ss = f"{i//s},{i%s}\n"
                    tn.write(str.encode(ss))
                    break
        
        except Exception:
            break

```

You may have to run it a few times if it does not solve it in the first run.
